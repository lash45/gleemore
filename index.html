      <p>
        At Gleemore Consult, we strongly believe that writing, in whatever form, sharpens the brain, helps the mind to be analytic thereby improving critical thinking and increasing one’s desires for reading. As we know, there are no good writers without having, for at least once, been good readers. Thus for students to succeed in their academic endeavours at any level, they must be readily prepared to do a lot of writing. This writing is not limited to taking note and making note during classes or study periods. We are also considering a possibility of helping them to undertake writing as a career and from there determine what kind of writer they aspire to become. Ultimately, we intend to motivate them so as to explore writing as an enjoyable mental exercise and a medium of intellectual and academic assessment and a way of paying attention to details such as being conscious of one’s environment without missing out on anything noteworthy.

      <p>
       
Therefore, young people with entrepreneurial skills which have the intention to take over or found businesses are needed. To reach this goal, strategic measures are needed to boost entrepreneurial intentions of young people. In order to foster the entrepreneurial spirit, several initiatives for raising awareness and changing attitudes have been launched within the educational system. However, it was found out that the school related initiatives alone have not been able to yield expected result while the job opportunity is getting worse day by day, hence, the need for the intervention of Gleemore Consult to illuminate the darkest archive where entrepreneurial skills is hidden and reveal the secret of what makes a successful job giver and/or improve one’s employability and productivity.

     <div class=" subhead gender">Gender Awareness</div>
      <p>
        In addition to our educational services, GM Consult also educates students on the need to be sensitive to their gender and keep themselves abreast of its social configurations in order to rise above the ensuing challenges as they progress in life. We therefore train the girl-child to always take note of the delicate nature of her body especially as she attains pubertal stage as well as sensitise the boy-child to know that his manliness is not meant for destruction but rather to bring about positive psycho-social and physiological traits within himself and the opposite gender thereby shunning unacceptable sexual behaviours.
